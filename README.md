[![Update spack develop version](https://github.com/haampie/spack-batteries-included/actions/workflows/update-spack.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/haampie/spack-batteries-included/actions/workflows/update-spack.yaml)

# ðŸ”‹ Spack with batteries included (linux/x86_64)

[Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) is a package manager, and package managers should be trivial to install. 

This repo offers a single, static executable for Spack:

```console
$ wget -qO spack.x https://github.com/haampie/spack-batteries-included/releases/download/develop/spack-x86_64.x
$ chmod +x spack.x
$ ./spack.x install zstd +programs ~shared build_type=Release
```
## What version of Spack is shipped?

The URL above gives you a rolling release of Spack's develop branch, which is updated
hourly. The exact commit SHA is included as a file and can be retrieved like this:

```console
$ spack.x --squashfs-extract spack_sha && cat spack/spack_sha
[prints the Spack commit sha]
```

## Supported platforms

- CentOS 7 and above
- Ubuntu 14.04 and above
- Debian 8 and above
- Fedora 20 and above
- SUSE Linux 13 and above
- Arch Linux
- Gentoo
- Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 with any of the above distro's.

The system dependencies are `glibc 2.17` and above and optionally the `fusermount`
executable. If your system supports rootless containers it likely has `fusermount`
installed already!

## How does it work?
`spack.x` consists of a modified version of the AppImage runtime concatenated
with a big squashfs file which includes `binutils`, `bzip2`, `clingo`, `curl`, `file`,
`git`, `gmake`, `gzip`, `openssl`, `patch`, `patchelf`, `python`, `tar`, `unzip`, `xz`,
`zstd` and their dependencies.

When you run `spack.x [args]` it will use `fusermount` to
mount this squashfs file in a temporary directory, and then execute the
entrypoint executable [spack](build/6_spack/spack).

The `spack` executable sets some environment variables like `PATH` and
`DL_LIBRARY_PATH` to the bin and lib folders of the squashfs file, and then it
executes `python3 spack_src/bin/spack [args]`.

When the command is done running, the runtime unmounts the squashfs file again.

## My system doesn't allow me to use `fusermount`, what now?

`fusermount` is used to mount a squashfs file included in the binary. If you
don't want that, you can just extract it:

```
$ spack.x --squashfs-extract
$ ./spack/spack
usage: spack [-hkV] [--color {always,never,auto}] COMMAND ...
```

but working with the extracted `spack` folder can come with a performance
penalty on shared filesystems in HPC centers.

## Differences and improvements over AppImage runtime
- spack.x uses `zstd` for faster decompression;
- spack.x has an entirely static binary for the runtime
- spack.x can extract itself without libfuse.so or libfuse3.so present on the
  system.

## Caveats
**immutability** The squashfs mountpoint is a readonly folder, meaning that
spack can't write to spack/{var,opt} folders. spack.x is configured to use some
non-standard directories, see `spack.x config blame config` for details.

Note, spack.x applies [this patch](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/20158/)
to ensure that log files are written to the `config:misc_cache` folder.

**openssl**: curl/git/openssl have to use system certificates. I'm not making any
assumptions on the system, but rather I'm just setting the `SSL_CERT_DIR`
and `GIT_SSL_CAPATH` variables to a list of common paths. This seems to work fine
on most systems.

If your certificates are in a non-standard location, point `SSL_CERT_DIR`
and `GIT_SSL_CAPATH` to it, or in some cases `SSL_CERT_FILE` and `GIT_SSL_CERT`.

## Can I run spack.x inside a container?

Yes, but please don't! Since `fusermount` is a setuid binary, you will need to
run a privileged container, which is never a good idea.

The recommended way to run spack.x inside a container is to just extract it:

```console
$ spack.x --squashfs-extract
$ ./spack/spack --version
```

If you insist on running spack.x in Docker, this is one way to do it:

```console
$ sudo docker run --privileged --device /dev/fuse -it -v $PWD/spack.x:/bin/spack.x ubuntu:18.04
# apt update && apt install fuse # install fusermount
# spack.x --version
```

## Running an executable shipped with spack.x directly

If you want to run an executable shipped with `spack.x` directly instead
of invoking spack (the default entrypoint), try this:

```console
$ NO_ENTRYPOINT= spack.x which python
/tmp/.mount_spack.h0zr1h/view/bin/python
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How do I build spack.x myself?

Initially you may need docker to get a rootfs filesystem for centos 7.

Building goes like this:

```console
make rootfs-with-spack
make
```

You'll find the output in

```
build/output
```
